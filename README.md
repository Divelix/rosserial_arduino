# Pre-built rosserial_arduino library
This repository is an analog of [this](https://github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation/rosserial_arduino_libs) and [that](https://github.com/frankjoshua/rosserial_arduino_lib) repos, but built from up-to-date version of rosserial (0.9.2), so it allows to use subscriber callbacks inside classes and not use static members.

I tried to use it only for Arduino MEGA, so can't guarantee that it will work for any other board.
